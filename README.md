# Nationbuilder Webhooks Sample App

Currently the app accepts a post payload to the url https://murmuring-tundra-2773.herokuapp.com/webhooks, this payload is only generated by my nation **organizerkevincoleman** when someone is contacted. When the payload is sent, the app parses the payload and then logs a private note on the profile of the person who was contacted. The magic happens [here](https://github.com/kevinjcoleman/webhookz/blob/master/app/controllers/api_controller.rb#L10)!

### Next steps
-Continue implementation with devise.
-Encrypt users api tokens
-Display nation's they've added along with current webhooks
-Allow creation of new webhooks
-Implement basic testing
