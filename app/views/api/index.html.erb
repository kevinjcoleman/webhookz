<h1>Nationbuilder Webhookz</h1>

<p>Currently the app accepts a post payload to the url https://murmuring-tundra-2773.herokuapp.com/webhooks, this payload is only generated by my nation <strong>organizerkevincoleman</strong> when someone is contacted. When the payload is sent, the app parses the payload and then logs a private note on the profile of the person who was contacted. The magic happens <a href="https://github.com/kevinjcoleman/webhookz/blob/master/app/controllers/api_controller.rb#L10">here</a>.</p>
